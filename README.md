# NimbleZTA

Add [Zero Trust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) Auth (ZTA) to your Plug/Phoenix web apps. In a nutshell, if you are running applications inside your private cloud, you can use your cloud provider to identify and control access to your app, so you can focus on your application logic.

`nimble_zta` is a collection of strategies for different providers. CloudFlare, Google Cloud Platform, and Tailscale are currently supported, with additional HTTP Basic Auth and Pass Through strategies available for development and testing. [Read the docs for more information](https://hexdocs.pm/nimble_zta).

[This library was extracted from Livebook](https://livebook.dev/).
